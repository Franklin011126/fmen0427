ChatPet: Where Code Meets Companionship

Welcome to ChatPet, your own terminal-based pet simulator written in Python. In this interactive text game, you adopt a digital companion — choose from a playful Dog, a clever Cat, a chill Turtle, or a cheerful Bunny — and care for it through a variety of commands like Feed, Play, Rest, and Talk. Each pet has its own Hunger, Happiness, and Energy stats that shift with every choice you make.

But it’s not just about feeding routines — pets have moods too. They’ll react differently depending on how you treat them. Neglect them too long, and they’ll get grumpy or tired. Overfeed them, and they might complain! Talk to them regularly and they’ll open up with cheerful messages — or grumpy ones if you’ve been careless.

Each round includes a chance for fun surprises: pets might find snacks, sneeze, or even nap on their own. With cute ASCII art, mood bubbles, and randomized events, ChatPet brings personality into your terminal window — no GUI needed.

Do you have what it takes to be a great virtual pet parent?
